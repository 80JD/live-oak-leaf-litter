# How to Add Your Amazon Product Images

## Quick Instructions:

1. **Get Your Image URLs from Amazon:**
   - Go to your Amazon listing: https://www.amazon.com/Lone-Star-Leaf-Litter-Enrichment/dp/B0DK7MGN33
   - Right-click on each product image
   - Select "Copy Image Address" or "Copy Image Link"

2. **Replace the Placeholder Images in index.html:**

Find these lines in your index.html file:

```html
<!-- Main Product Image (Line ~308) -->
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x600/8B4513/FFFFFF?text=Your+Product+Image+1" alt="Lone Star Leaf Litter - Texas Live Oak" style="max-width: 100%; border: 3px solid #000;">

<!-- Thumbnail Images (Lines ~311-313) -->
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150x150/8B4513/FFFFFF?text=Image+2" alt="Product view 2" style="width: 150px; border: 2px solid #000; margin: 0.5rem;">
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150x150/8B4513/FFFFFF?text=Image+3" alt="Product view 3" style="width: 150px; border: 2px solid #000; margin: 0.5rem;">
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150x150/8B4513/FFFFFF?text=Image+4" alt="Product view 4" style="width: 150px; border: 2px solid #000; margin: 0.5rem;">
```

Replace the `src="..."` part with your actual Amazon image URLs.

## Example:

BEFORE:
```html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x600/8B4513/FFFFFF?text=Your+Product+Image+1" ...>
```

AFTER (with your real image):
```html
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ABC123DEF.jpg" ...>
```

## Alternative - Use Your Own Photos:

If you have your own product photos saved locally:
1. Upload them to a free image hosting service like:
   - Imgur.com
   - ImgBB.com
   - Or add them to your GitHub repository
2. Copy the direct image link
3. Replace the placeholder URLs with your image links

## Tips:
- Use high-quality images (at least 600x600px for the main image)
- Make sure images show your product clearly
- Consider showing: the bag, leaves spread out, leaves in a terrarium setup
- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 1MB per image)

Your site will look much more professional with real product photos!
