# How to Add Your Product Images - SIMPLE VERSION

## You have 4 placeholder images on your homepage:

1. **Main product image** (600x600px) - Shows "Lone Star Leaf Litter - Texas Live Oak"
2. **Thumbnail 1** (150x150px) - Shows "Close Up"
3. **Thumbnail 2** (150x150px) - Shows "In Terrarium"
4. **Thumbnail 3** (150x150px) - Shows "Package"

## Option 1: Use Your Amazon Images (Easiest)

1. Go to your Amazon listing
2. Right-click each product photo
3. Select "Copy Image Address"
4. Open index.html in a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)
5. Find these lines (around line 73-77):

```html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x600/8B4513/FFFFFF?text=Lone+Star+Leaf+Litter+-+Texas+Live+Oak"
```

6. Replace the URL with your Amazon image URL:

```html
<img src="YOUR_AMAZON_IMAGE_URL_HERE"
```

7. Do the same for the 3 thumbnail images below it
8. Save the file
9. Upload to GitHub (replace the old index.html)

## Option 2: Upload Your Own Images

1. Take/get 4 photos of your product:
   - Main product shot
   - Close-up of leaves
   - Leaves in a terrarium
   - Package/bag shot

2. Name them:
   - product-main.jpg
   - product-closeup.jpg
   - product-terrarium.jpg
   - product-package.jpg

3. Upload them to GitHub in an "images" folder

4. In index.html, change the image sources to:

```html
<img src="images/product-main.jpg" alt="...">
<img src="images/product-closeup.jpg" alt="...">
<img src="images/product-terrarium.jpg" alt="...">
<img src="images/product-package.jpg" alt="...">
```

## The placeholder images are brown/tan colored boxes

They're clearly placeholders so you know exactly what to replace!

When you visit your site at liveoakleaflitter.com, you'll see these brown placeholder boxes until you add your real images.
